# IkeaPack [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ikkerens/ikeapack.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ikkerens/ikeapack) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/ikkerens/ikeapack)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/ikkerens/ikeapack) [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/ikkerens/ikeapack?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/ikkerens/ikeapack)

> Named IkeaPack because it compacts structs in a very compact and packed manner, and if you don't know how to reassemble it, it may just look like a random blob of parts. Just like ikea products!

(If anyone from ikea doesn't like me using their name, just reach out to me and I'll change it, no copyright/trademark infringement intended.)

This is a packed struct serializer that is mostly meant for a private project but was released as it may be useful to someone else.

Originally this package was made as an extension to binary.Read and binary.Write, but I soon found those functions didn't match my use case as they offered no support for strings nor compression.

#### Features
* Caches types for faster calls to the same type
* Compression support
* Tread safe (the calls are, reading to the value is not)
* Easy to implement in other languages
* Supported types:
  * uint8 (and byte) up to uint64
  * int8 up to int64
  * float32 and float64
  * string
  * anything implementing the Packer/Unpacker interfaces
  * slices
  * structs

#### Format
* All primitives are stored in big endian format
* All slices are stored with a uint32 prefix indicating their length
* Strings are stored with a uint32 prefix indicating their length
* Compression blocks are stored using deflate (level 9) with a uint32 prefixing the size of the compressed data blob

#### Note about int/uint
The types `int` and `uint` are not supported because their actual sizes depend on the compiler architecture.  
Instead, be explicit and use int32/int64/uint32/uint64.

## Include in your project
```go
import "github.com/ikkerens/ikeapack"
```

## Usage
```go
package main

import (
	"bytes"
	"log"

	"github.com/ikkerens/ikeapack"
)

type myBlob struct {
	A uint64 // all fields have to be exported
	B []byte `ikea:"compress:9"` // this field will be packed and compressed, with flate level 5
	C subBlob                    // If you omit the level `ikea:"compress"`, level 9 will be assumed.
	D int32 `ikea:"skip"` // Or `ikea:"-"`
}

type subBlob struct {
	D string
}

func main() {
	b := new(bytes.Buffer)
	blob := &myBlob{A: 1, B: []byte{1, 2, 3, 4}, C: subBlob{D: "test message"}}

	// Pack
	if err := ikea.Pack(b, blob); err != nil { // Write does not need a pointer, but it is recommended
		log.Fatalln(err)
	}

	// Unpack
	newBlob := new(myBlob)
	if err := ikea.Unpack(b, newBlob); err != nil { // Read *needs* a pointer, or it will panic
		log.Fatalln(err)
	}

	log.Printf("Successfully unpacked: %+v", newBlob)
}
```

## Benchmarks
These benchmarks are based on [alecthomas](https://github.com/alecthomas)'s [go serialization benchmarks](https://github.com/alecthomas/go_serialization_benchmarks). While not all benchmarks are included since not all dependencies could resolve, these give a good overview of the performance of this lib vs the others.  
Note that this library does not have a focus on *being* the fastest in any way, as this was made to cover a specific use-case. But it does strive to be as fast as it can be.

These benchmarks were executed on a Dell laptop with an i7-8550U cpu and 16GB of ram.

Below you will find some of the benchmarks that do not rely on Go's reflection at runtime, which creates a significant performance boost, but for diligence it's worth mentioning here regardless.
